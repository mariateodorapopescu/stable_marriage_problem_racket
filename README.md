# Stable Marriage Problem Solver in Racket

Solve the age-old puzzle of stable marriages with elegance and efficiency using our Racket implementation. Whether you're fascinated by algorithms or simply curious about creating harmonious unions, this program is for you!

## About the Stable Marriage Problem

The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) involves matching an equal number of men and women based on their ranked preferences, ensuring that there are no unstable pairs â€“ where a man and a woman prefer each other over their current partners.

## Features

- **Intuitive Representation**: SMP instances are modeled as dynamic preference lists for both men and women.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Leverage the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find stable marriages efficiently.
- **Dynamic Preferences**: Handle changes in preferences over time with our innovative approach.
- **Functional Programming**: Embrace the power of functional programming with Racket's expressive syntax.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Run the program: `racket main.rkt`

## Usage

1. Define your initial preferences in `men-preferences-0` and `women-preferences-0`.
2. Update preferences for the next time interval in `men-preferences-1` and `women-preferences-1`.
3. Run the program to find stable marriages over time!

## Functions

- **`get-men`**: Retrieve the list of all men in the problem.
- **`get-women`**: Get the list of all women in the problem.
- **`get-pref-list`**: Obtain the preference list of a specific person.
- **`preferable?`**: Check if one person is preferable to another.
- **`get-partner`**: Find the partner of a specific person.
- **`better-match-exists?`**: Determine if a better match exists for a person.
- **`stable-match?`**: Check if a set of marriages is stable.
- **`engage`**: Engage men with women using the Gale-Shapley algorithm.
- **`gale-shapley`**: Execute the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable marriages.
- **`get-couple-members`**: Extract individual members from a list of couples.
